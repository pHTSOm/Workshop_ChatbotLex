**Amazon Lex** offers powerful conversational interfaces using voice and text channels.  It has natural language understanding characteristics that allow it to comprehend and fulfill user intent more accurately and quickly.

**Amazon Bedrock** makes it easier to build and scale generative AI systems using large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs).  It provides access to a varied set of foundation models from top vendors including Anthropic Claude, AI21 Labs, Cohere, and Stability AI, as well as Amazon's own Amazon Titan models.  Furthermore, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases enables you to create applications that take advantage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique in which retrieving relevant information from data sources improves the model's ability to generate contextually appropriate and informed responses.

The solution uses Amazon Lex, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Bedrock in the following steps:

- Users communicate with the chatbot via a pre-built Amazon Lex web interface.
- Amazon Lex processes each user request in order to detect user intent using an algorithm known as intent recognition.
- Amazon Lex has the built-in generative AI tool QnAIntent, which can be linked directly to a knowledge base to fulfill user requests.
- Centralized management of users using AWS IAM.
- Access to the server easily and simply with one click.
- Faster access time than traditional methods like SSH
- Support many different operating systems such as Linux, Windows, MacOS
- Log the connection sessions and commands executed while connecting to the server.
