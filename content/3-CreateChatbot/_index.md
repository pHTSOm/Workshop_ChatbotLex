In the following section, we will learn how to build a chatbot with Amazon Lex.  Chatbots are useful in improving user interactions.  We'll explore how Amazon Lex uses a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock to offer more accurate replies.  When a user poses a query, Amazon Titan embeddings transform it into a vector.  This enables the system to extract relevant information from the knowledge base.  The added context allows the chatbot to provide more accurate replies.  In the following sections, we will look at how to create an effective chatbot that understands user questions and uses a strong knowledge base to improve conversations.
